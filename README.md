# Brendel Group Handbook

The Brendel Group is an energetic, friendly, and grateful team of faculty, staff, and students enjoying the privilege of working together.
Our areas of interest span research topics in genome informatics, in particular as related to plant transcriptional control and pre-mRNA splicing, and computational infrastructure (cyberinfrastructure) for genome studies.

This handbook provides documentation for lab protocols and operating procedures, as well as a primer for some of the basic research tools we use frequently.
We hope this handbook proves useful to students interested in participating in the lab, long-time lab members, and collaborators alike.

## Organization

This handbook is organized as follows.

- `doc`: technical tutorials, lab standard operating procedures, and other documentation
- `bin`: scripts or programs that are ready to execute
- `src`: source code that must be compiled before it can be executed
- `data`: sample data sets
- `scratch`: an informal sandbox space in which to try out new things before officially integrating them
