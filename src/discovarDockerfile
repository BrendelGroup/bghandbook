# A Dockerfile to build a DISCOVAR de novo Docker image.
# The image built by this Dockerfile is best run with the working directory 
# mounted as a volume to the Docker container using the "-v" flag. Example:
# sudo docker run -v $(pwd):/stuff discovar-docker READS=/stuff/sample-reads.bam OUT_DIR=/stuff/discovardenovo-assembly-aligned REFHEAD=/stuff/sample-genome

# The first instruction for any Dockerfile must be "FROM"
# "FROM" designates a previous Docker image (often from the public repositories)
# that serves as the basis for the Docker image being built. In this case, the 
# latest version of debian that has been experimentally 'slimmed' by removal of
# things such as man-pages. 
FROM debian:jessie-slim

# The "ARG" instruction can set an environmental variable during the build stage
# that does not remain set in the final image. "DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive"
# prevents some warnings from apt-get.
ARG DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive 

# The "RUN" instruction is used to run command line commands. It is important 
# that "apt-get update" and "apt-get upgrade" be in the same line because 
# changes like "apt-get update" and "cd" do not persist between commands. 
# Instructions may be broken up onto multiple lines for readability with the use
# of "\". Docker convention is for installation packages to be alphabetically
# listed. This is helpful for finding things when the list is very long.
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install --no-install-recommends -y \
    build-essential \
    file \
    libjemalloc-dev \
    libz-dev \
    samtools \
    wget

# Unlike the command "cd", the Docker instruction "WORKDIR" creates a persistent
# change in the working directory for the instructions following it.
WORKDIR / 

# The latest version of DISCOVAR de novo can be obtained from their FTP site. 
# In this case I am pointing at a specific version so that I can use WORKDIR 
# later in this Dockerfile.
RUN wget ftp://ftp.broadinstitute.org/pub/crd/DiscovarDeNovo/latest_source_code/discovardenovo-52488.tar.gz && tar -xzf discovardenovo-52488.tar.gz && rm discovardenovo-52488.tar.gz
WORKDIR /discovardenovo-52488
RUN ./configure && make all && make install

# If you download and unpack DISCOVAR de novo in the same directory as the 
# Dockerfile, you can copy it into the image. Everything in the directory 
# containing the Dockerfile is sent to the docker daemon for use during build.
#RUN mkdir /discovardenovo-52488
#COPY discovardenovo-52488 /discovardenovo-52488
#WORKDIR /discovardenovo-52488
#RUN ./configure && make all && make install

WORKDIR /
# The "ENTRYPOINT" instruction, given a command (in this case, "DiscovarDeNovo")
# means that running the Docker image automatically runs DiscovarDeNovo. 
# Arguments to the Docker run go directly to the DiscovarDeNovo command.
