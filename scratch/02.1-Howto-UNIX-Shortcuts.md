# Working with __shortcuts__ in UNIX

When introducing students to UNIX or when watching our experienced group members, it never fails
to amaze how different users interact with the commandline in very different ways.
Most striking is the difference in efficiency.
Some users will type at a speed that makes it hard to figure out what exactly was being done, but
there the result appeared.
Other will type very slowly or lots of letters or use the mouse a lot for copy/paste operations,
and they might well get to the same result but a lot later.
We'll not advise on typing skills here (although such skills are still hugely helpful).
However, there are many tricks to learn how to work more efficiently.

One of the easiest ways to get things done more efficiently is using shortcuts.
You can define shortcuts in your _.bashrc_ file in your home directory.
This file is read by the system every time you open a new terminal.
Below is part of what some of us found useful in our _.bashrc_ files.
Note the use of _alias_ and _function_.
In each case, the name of the _alias_ or _function_ will execute what was defined.
For example, typing _duh_ will show you disk usage in human readable form (executing the _du_ command with specific options that you won't need to remember nor type at this point).
Typing _mason_ will clear your terminal and put you to a login to _mason.indiana.edu_.

Try things out!
After you made changes to your _.bashrc_ file, execute _source .bashrc_ to make the system recognize your wishes.


```
# .bashrc

# Source global definitions
if [ -f /etc/bashrc ]; then
        . /etc/bashrc
fi


# User specific aliases and functions
PS1="[\#]"


# Alias definitions

alias cp='cp -i'
alias df='df -H'
alias duh='du -H --max-depth=1'
alias find1d='find . -mtime -1 -print | more'
alias find2d='find . -mtime -2 -print | more'
alias find3d='find . -mtime -3 -print | more'
alias find3h='find . -mmin -180 -print | more'
alias home='clear; cd; echo "$HOSTNAME"; pwd; echo""; ls; echo""; date; echo ""'
alias lpr='lpr -h'
alias lst='ls -lt'
alias lsf='ls -F'
alias mv='mv -i'
alias rm='rm -i'
alias swd='clear; echo "$HOSTNAME"; pwd; echo""; ls; echo""; date; echo""'
function texclean() { \rm *.aux *.bbl *.blg *.dvi *.log *.toc; \rm */*.aux */*.bbl */*.blg */*.dvi */*.log */*.toc; }



# Communication settings

function mason() {
        clear; echo "$HOSTNAME"; pwd; echo ""; ls; echo ""; \
        echo ""; echo "Connecting to mason.indiana.edu:"; echo ""; \
        echo ""; $USERNAME@mason.indiana.edu; \
        }                                                                                                               
```
